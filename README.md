Arduino M0 Firmware for Tronic's Microsytems Evaluation Kit

## Installation

1.	Connect the Arduino M0 board to your computer using the USB cable and the Native USB Port. If this is the first time you are connecting an Arduino M0 Board to your computer, please wait a few minutes before going on, as Windows needs to install all the necessary drivers.

2.	Open Arduino IDE.
3.	Open the “Boards Manager” in the Tools > Board menu. 


4.	Install latest version of "Arduino SAMD Boards (32-Bits ARM Cortex M0+)" 

5.	Select “Arduino M0” in the Tools > Board menu. 
 
6.	Select the serial port number corresponding to the Arduino board in the Tools > Port menu. The name “Arduino M0” should be associated with the correct COM port. 

7.	Now, you need install Tronics EVB Library : Click on “Add .ZIP Library…” in the Sketch > Include Library menu.
 

8.	Select “TronicsEvaluationKit_Library” in the “Arduino Firmware & IDE” folder into the USB flash drive.
9.	Now, you can open “EvaluationTool_2_1” firmware” in the Examples menu. 

10.	Upload the program: Simply click on the "Upload" button in the environment. Wait a few seconds, and you should see the RX and TX LEDs on the board flashing. If the upload is successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the window. 

11.	Close Arduino IDE

> NOW YOUR ARDUINO M0 BOARD IS PROGRAMMED AND READY TO BE USED WITH TRONICS EVALUATION TOOL.
